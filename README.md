# AHK

A repo with a collection of scripts that I use/have used.

## Some scripts



### Common typos

Automatically fixes some common typos I make.

### Capslock LED

The capslock light on my keyboard is broken; this makes the scrolllock light as the capslock light.


### Diacritics

This contains shortcuts for typing diacritics like è, ë, ô with keyboard shortcuts consistently over all applications, and those that I prefer.


### DisableMouseMoveWhenVLCIsFullScreen

Prevents the mouse cursor from showing up while watching something in VLC.

### WindowsVolume

Changes the volume buttons behavior in Windows 10 to suit my preference.

### MButton to ctrl

Makes the middle mouse button work as a control toggle such that I can zoom on websites and ctrl+click when I'm sitting far away from the screen (i.e. on bed) and my keyboard isn't accessible.

### MediaKeysDispatcher

Remaps some media keys such that VLC can pick them up (VLC's global keyboard shortcuts is somewhat buggy).

### RWin to Menu and Numlock always on and make Scroll Lock LED denote caps lock. 

Combines two scripts into 1.


### RWin to Menu and Numlock always on

Swaps Rwin keys and menu key, and disables the numlock key (which should be always on) in case I accidentally press it.

(I believe the Numlock functionality doesn't work).


### ScrollVolume and MButton

Combines two scripts into 1.

### ScrollVolume 

Makes the scroll wheel in VLC and youtube behave like the volume bar. 

(Doesn't work I believe).

### StoreClipboard

Dumps all text on the clipboard to a file on the desktop whenever the clipboard changes.


### TypeOutClipboard

Allows you to paste text as though the keyboard typed it (for e.g. terminals and fields in which you're not allowed to paste, but are allowed to type).
